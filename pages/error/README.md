# Disclaimer as to why this folder only have Symlinks

At fiery.me, we are using this: [https://github.com/BobbyWibowo/HttpErrorPages](https://github.com/BobbyWibowo/HttpErrorPages).

It's nothing too important, but we are sharing the error pages from that directory to all other instances in the server (regular http sites with nginx and node servers).
